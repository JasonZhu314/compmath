# CompMath - Python implementations of computational mathematics algorithms

These are my implementations of important computational mathematics algorithms when self-studying numerical analysis and numerical linear algebra. Uses Numpy and PyTorch for the algorithms, MatPlotLib for plotting and SciPy for testing results and benchmarking.

This code library is for educational purposes only and obviously not to be used anywhere else, since it contains from-scratch pure NumPy implementations and is not optimized for speed.
